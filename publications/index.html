    <p>Current approaches for assessing the effects of invasive alien species (IAS) are biased toward the negative effects of these species, resulting in an incomplete picture of their real effects. This can result in an inefficient IAS management. We address this issue by describing the INvasive Species Effects Assessment Tool (INSEAT) that enables expert elicitation for rapidly assessing the ecological consequences of IAS using the ecosystem services (ES) framework. INSEAT scores the ecosystem service “gains and losses” using a scale that accounted for the magnitude and the reversibility of its effects. We tested INSEAT on 18 IAS in Great Britain. Here, we highlighted four case studies: Harmonia axyridis (Harlequin ladybird), Astacus leptodactylus (Turkish crayfish), Pacifastacus leniusculus (Signal crayfish) and Impatiens glandulifera (Himalayan balsam). The results demonstrated that a collation of different experts’ opinions using INSEAT could yield valuable information on the invasive aliens’ ecological and social effects. The users can identify certain IAS as ES providers and the trade‐offs between the ES provision and loss associated with them. This practical tool can be useful for evidence‐based policy and management decisions that consider the potential role of invasive species in delivering human well‐being.</p>

    <p>Motivated by the high electric vehicle (EV) penetration percentages foreseen for the near future, this paper studies the participation of large fleets of EVs in electricity day-ahead markets. Specifically, we consider a scenariowhere a number of independent and self-interested EV aggregators participate in the day-ahead market to purchase energy to satisfy their clients’ driving needs. In this scenario, independent bidding can drive prices up unnecessarily, resulting in increased electricity costs for all participants. Inter-aggregator cooperation can mitigate this by pro- ducing coordinated bids. However, this is challenging due to the self-interested nature of the aggregators, who may try to manipulate the system in order to obtain personal benefit. In order to overcome this issue, we employ techniques from mechanism design to develop a coordination mechanism which incentivises self-interested EV aggregators to report their energy requirements truthfully to a third-party coordinator. This coordinator is then able to employ a day-ahead bidding algorithm to optimise the global bids on their behalf, extending the benefits of smart bidding to groups of competing EV aggregators. Importantly, the proposed coordination mechanism is straightforward to implement and does not require any additional infrastructure. To ensure scalability and computational tractability, a novel price-maker day-ahead bidding algorithmis proposed, which is formulated in terms of simple energy requirement constraints. The coordination mechanism substantially reduces bidding costs, as shown in a case study which uses real market and driver data from the Iberian Peninsula.</p>

    <p>Given the rapid rise of electric vehicles (EVs) worldwide, and the ambitious targets set for the near future, the management of large EV fleets must be seen as a priority. Specifically, we study a scenario where EV charging is managed through self-interested EV aggregators who compete in the day-ahead market in order to purchase the electricity needed to meet their clients’ requirements. In order to reduce electricity costs and lower the impact on electricity markets, a centralised bidding coordination framework has been proposed in the literature employing a coordinator. In order to improve privacy and limit the need for the coordinator, we propose a reformulation of the coordination framework as a decentralised algorithm, employing the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). However, given the self-interested nature of the aggregators, they can deviate from the algorithm in order to improve their personal utility. Hence, we study strategic manipulation of the ADMM algorithm and, in doing so, describe and analyse different attack vectors, and propose a mathematical framework to quantify and detect manipulation. Finally, we test the decentralised coordination and manipulation detection algorithms in realistic scenarios using real market and driver data from Spain. Our empirical results show the convergence of the coordination algorithm, and that the detection algorithm accurately detects deviating behaviour in up to 96% of the cases.</p>

    <p>We study the equilibrium distribution of relative strategy scores of agents in the asymmetric phase (α≡ P/N \textgreater 1) of the basic Minority Game using sign-payoff, with N agents holding two strategies over P histories.We formulate a statistical model that makes use of the gauge freedom with respect to the ordering of an agent’s strategies to quantify the correlation between the attendance and the distribution of strategies. The relative score x ∈ Z of the two strategies of an agent is described in terms of a one dimensional random walk with asymmetric jump probabilities, leading either to a static and asymmetric exponential distribution centered at x = 0 for fickle agents or to diffusion with a positive or negative drift for frozen agents. In terms of scaled coordinates x/√N and t/N the distributions are uniquely given by αand in quantitative agreement with direct simulations of the game. As themodel avoids the reformulation in terms of a constrainedminimization problem it can be used for arbitrary payoff functions with little calculational effort and provides a transparent and simple formulation of the dynamics of the basic Minority Game in the asymmetric phase.</p>

    <p>We consider mechanisms for the online allocation of perishable resources such as energy or computational power. The main application is electric vehicle charging where agents arrive and leave over time. Unlike previous work, we consider mechanisms without money, and a range of objectives including fairness and efficiency. In doing so, we extend the concept of envy-freeness to online settings. Furthermore, we explore the trade-offs between different objectives and analyse their theoretical properties both in online and offline settings. We then introduce novel online scheduling algorithms and compare them in terms of both their theoretical properties and empirical performance.</p>

    <p>Motivated by the high electric vehicle (EV) penetration percentages foreseen for the near future, we study the integration of large fleets of electric vehicles into the existing electricity market structure, with special emphasis on day-ahead markets. Specifically, the large energy requirements characteristic of the widespread use of EVs require careful managing in order to limit environmental and infrastructural impacts. A key characteristic of EVs is their intrinsic flexibility, given that most vehicles are idle most of the day. This translates into coordination opportunities which allow for the temporal spreading of the energy consumption of an EV fleet, avoiding unnecessary demand peaks which translate into increased electricity prices and stress in the grid. Given the self-interested nature of market participants, this coordination is challenging and needs to be carefully addressed.</p>

    <p>Given the rapid rise of electric vehicles (EVs) worldwide, and the ambitious targets set for the near future, the smart charging of an EV fleet must be seen as a priority. Specifically, we study a scenario where EV charging is managed through self-interested EV aggregators (<i>e.g.</i> car parks or electricity suppliers) who compete in the day-ahead market in order to purchase the electricity needed to meet their clients’ requirements. In order to reduce electricity costs and lower the impact on electricity markets, we study the possibility of inter-aggregator cooperation. Specifically, we model the system as a coalitional game and prove that the resulting game is superadditive and balanced, hence having a non-empty core. However, due to the game not being convex, the Shapley value is not guaranteed to lie in the core. As an alternative, we propose employing the payment mechanism provided by the least-core, which we show to be in the core in our setting. Furthermore, a realistic empirical evaluation is presented, using real market and driver data from the Iberian Peninsula. The simulations show that large payment reductions can be achieved when using the coordination mechanism. Moreover, we show that the individual payments of the least-core are very close to the Shapley value, suggesting that the payment mechanism is both fair and stable.</p>

    <p>PythonTool is a modification (mod) of the game Minecraft, which allows visual and interactive in-game execution of Python scripts which alter the Minecraft world in real time. It makes use of existing software libraries such as mcpi and RaspberryJam-Mod, and tries to improve and ease the programming experience. A non-traditional programming workflow using Jupyter Notebook is also proposed to complement the mod. This project was developed at the University of Southampton.</p>
